                        <h2>Allow me to introduce myself</h2>
                        <p>My name is <span>Charles Vines, Jr.</span> and I am a Freelance Front-End Web Developer. I am based out of <span>Philadelphia, PA</span> (Go Eagles!!!). The tools in my front end utility belt are <span>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap</span>. My approach to web development is organization and simplicity with a splash of character. I help my clients show potential customers who they are and what they provide as quick and efficient as possible. In this world where we get our information at the snap of a finger, companies need to be able to let customers know what value they provide as quickly as possible before the customer is on to the next thing. Let me help you build a website that will look great while also helping you expand your business to greater heights!</p>

                        <p>When I am not working with my awesome clients I am using my time to further my knowledge and learn new skills that will potential not only help me and my skills sets but will also allow me to implement the newest and up-to-date techniques to my clients projects. When I finally step away from the laptop and the pile of books on my desk I can be found running all around the city trying to break a new mile pr. I also enjoy hanging out at home cooking amazing dishes that I find on pinterest to fuel an action packed afternoon of gaming(If youâ€™re a gamer email your gamertag!).</p>
